Dimension Reduction
===================

When dealing with data samples with high dimensionality, we often need to
reduce the dimensions so we can better observe the data.

Projection
----------
One way to reduce the dimension is through projection. For example, in
functional principal component analysis, we project the data samples
into a smaller sample of functions that preserve the maximum sample
variance.
