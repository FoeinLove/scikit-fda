    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 5)
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.
    weights : str or callable, optional (default = 'uniform')
        weight function used in prediction.  Possible values:

        - 'uniform' : uniform weights.  All points in each neighborhood
          are weighted equally.
        - 'distance' : weight points by the inverse of their distance.
          in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a
          greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
        - [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an
          array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape
          containing the weights.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm based on
          the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.
    metric : string or callable, (default
        :func:`lp_distance <skfda.misc.metrics.lp_distance>`)
        the distance metric to use for the tree.  The default metric is
        the Lp distance. See the documentation of the metrics module
        for a list of available metrics.
    metric_params : dict, optional (default = None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.
    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors.
        Doesn't affect :meth:`fit` method.
